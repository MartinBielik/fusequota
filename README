fusequota README
----------------

fusequota is a FUSE filesystem that mirrors a directory, providing support
for enforcing quotas on arbitrary files or directories.

Building and Installing
-----------------------

In order to build and install fusequota, run the following commands from the
src directory:

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Mounting the Filesystem
-----------------------

The filesystem can be mounted with the following command:

# fusequota mount <mountpoint> <basedir>

The basedirdir is the directory that is being mirrored. The mountpoint is the
directory that the quota filesystem layer is exposed through.

Unmounting the filesystem can be accomplished with umount:

# umount <mountpoint>

Managing Quotas
---------------

Quotas can be managed with the quota command:

# fusequota set <path> <size> [-u<B|K|M|G|T>]
# fusequota get <path> [-u<B|K|M|G|T>]
# fusequota unset <path>

The path is the file or directory whose quota is being get or set. The size
should be a integer and the units can be specified in either bytes, kilobytes,
megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes.
