Urgent:

 - Test quota enforcing

In no particular order:

 - Are access controls correct? Right now only root can do anything...
 - Documentation on every static member and function
 - fusermount script and associated manpages
 - man pages for fusequota
 - caching
 - cweb documentation
 - fstab entry documentation
 - soft/hard limits?
 - notification?
