Urgent:

 - Test new changes
 - Unit tests for command line interface. It would be nice to be able to easily check if it works
 - Documentation for source organization

In no particular order:

 - Static analysis
 - Add options for get_binding, get_exceeded
 - Document quota.c
 - Document fuse ops
 - Document mounting procedure
 - Document setting quotas
 - mount script
 - man pages for quota, fuse (which should be mount, and probably renamed)
 - caching
 - cweb documentation
 - complain to sf about svn not working
 - fstab entry documentation
 - unit tests might be nice
 - Licenses at the top of files?
 - documentation headers in every file, I'd really like to find an established
   format
